Were you able to reach their endpoint on the web?
    I was not able to access their endpoint on the web as their report.html only offers the local host and not one of thier URLs to their project 2 that I would be able to test it on. 
What did you like about this service?
    Reading through the code, I like what they are attempting to do. The gym is something important to me so seeing a service where you can see a bunch of information about a user is cool.
What do you think about the paths that have been chosen?
    I think that the paths used are intuitive and make sense.

    are they consistent? is there any possible point of confusion?
        I believe they appear to be consistent and don't provide a point of confusion. 
What do you like about the structure of the responses from the different endpoints?
    Again, can't test so can't see the structure, but it appears, like Deven and I, they used the book structure so I am a fan of it, I think it's readable and looks nice.
Describe one significant difference between your own P2 seervice and this person's. E.g.
    Which might be easier to build a front end for (and why)?
        I think both are quite simple neither are going to be hard to implement a front end for as they are kind of the same thing theres is just about gym users and ours about league of legends champions.
    Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        At the moment I would say ours as we have a lot more comments dispersed throughout the code, but I reviewed Michaels last time and he had a lot of comments so I imagine they just haven't been added yet.
Is the code well-structured?
    It has a good structure to it.
Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    Can't find issues, unable to test.
Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    Don't forget to change local hosts to one of you or your partners website so that we can test it!!
